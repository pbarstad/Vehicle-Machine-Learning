# Vehicle-Machine-Learning

I completed this project in the Spring of 2019 at the end of the Machine Learning class I was enrolled in. The great thing about Jupyter Notebooks is a README is not necessary, the notebook has text along with the Python code and graphics to explain me and my partners work.
