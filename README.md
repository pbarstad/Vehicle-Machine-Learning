# Vehicle-Machine-Learning

I completed this project in the Spring of 2019 at the end of the Machine Learning class I was enrolled in. The great thing about Jupyter Notebooks is a README is not necessary, the notebook has text along with the Python code and graphics to explain me and my partners work.

Unfortunately I do not believe the Jupyter Notebook is viewable inside GitHub, so here is the link to the Google Collaboratory where we wrote everything. https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QSFhUfRGOTxM8hiR3JWYTuKiRwuq7ZZN
